# BFSI-Credit-Score-Case-Study
# Background
In recent times, there has been a drastic increase in the number of loan applications made at banking or financial institutions. And naturally, the number of loan defaulters has also increased simultaneously. It has thus, become very important for banks to understand customers' behavior. 

 

Now, since this problem has lurked in the BFSI domain for quite some time, multiple ways have developed to understand customer behaviour. Some of them include the credit utilisation ratio, the number of late payments, monthly account balance, and total income, among others. Many companies, such as TransUnion CIBIL, Equifax, Experian, and CRIF, determine the CIBIL score depending on multiple different parameters. 

 

Managing credit risk is essential for all companies and institutions that issue debt. While they are always working to battle the elements that increase the dangers, for example, cyberattacks, they also need to be on the lookout for careless or unreliable borrowers. This is because financial institutions lose a lot of money when borrowers don't pay back their loans. . Additionally, the collateral loses its value because the lender would still incur a loss. A complete failure to repay the outstanding loan balance could be even worse.

 

The aforementioned risks could significantly jeopardise a lending institution’s financial stability. Consequently, it becomes crucial to account for borrowers’ creditworthiness and have a mechanism in place to manage credit risk. With all of this in mind, let’s take a look at the problem statement now.

 

# Problem Statement
SmartLend is a financial institution that understands credit risk is inherent in banking. As you understood just now, credit risk simply refers to the possibility that payments may be made late or not at all, which may result in cash flow issues and may impact a bank’s liquidity. Despite advancements in the financial services industry, credit risk continues to be the key factor in bank failures. In most cases, this part of risk management accounts for more than 70% of a bank’s balance sheet. Therefore, it is imperative for any financial institution to determine customers’ credit scores and SmartLend is no exception.

 

The primary objective of this project is thus helping SmartLend to divide its customers into different credit score brackets based on their demographic and past transactions data.

 

# Goal
SmartLend would like to better understand the primary factors that contribute to a person's credit score based on their demographics and past transactions data.
Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict which credit bucket a customer would fall into.
SmartLend wants to use this information to make lending decisions more robust and accurate thereby decreasing their credit risk.
To summarise, as a business analyst, you want to find the answer to these questions:

How do various demographic and transaction features affect a person's credit score?
Based on the historical data, can you predict the factors that generally lead to a poor credit score? Identification of these customers is imperative to reduce credit risk.
On identification of these factors, how can you create a lending process that ensures that the institution is only lending money to customers with a relatively good credit score? 
Can you draw any business insights based on your developed model?
